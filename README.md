#football_code.ipynb
Is a set of code that I have used python to changed the structure of the data from spi_matches.csv to trans_football.csv

#football.twbx
I have made a little project for myself, based on the performance on Cardiff City last season.
If you click on dashboard 1 it also shows this year's performance, which you will see it's not great...
You can check on other team's by playing around with the filters on the top right

Please let me know if you have any feedback !
